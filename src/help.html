    Preparing to create the files:
    The program works with two different kind of files; .RAW files, and .txt files. 

    
    RAW files:
        The raw files contain the tree information as taken by the data collector; such file,
    can not be imported into a CAD program as they are originally collected; therefore, we must imported into Tree File Creator to remove everything
    except the trees information, and format the data in a way that it can be used by CAD and Excel.

    .txt files:
        Once the program converts the RAW information into data that can be used by CAD, and Excell, a .txt file is created along with a .csv file - more on the .csv file 
        later. The .txt file contains points data that can be used by CAD. In addition, the .txt file could be used by Tree File Creator to continue generating files from 
        the last created point.
