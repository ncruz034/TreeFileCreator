    Preparing to create the files:
    The program works with two different kind of files; .RAW files, and .txt files. 

    
    RAW files:
        The raw files contain the tree information as taken by the data collector; such file,
    can not be imported into a CAD program as they are originally collected; therefore, we must imported into Tree File Creator to remove everything
    except the trees information, and format the data in a way that it can be used by CAD and Excel.

    .txt files:
        Once the program converts the RAW information into data that can be used by CAD, and Excell, a .txt file is created along with a .csv file - more on the .csv file 
        later. The .txt file contains points data that can be used by CAD. In addition, the .txt file could be used by Tree File Creator to continue generating files from 
        the last created point.

    Create a single file:
        Start by moving the .RAW file from its original location into a folder called Trees; such folder is usually located inside the projects directory, if the folder does not 
        exist, created at (the project path)/documents/trees.

        Drag the .RAW file to the area in the program titled "Drop your files here!". 
        Two files (.txt, .csv) will be created in the same directory where the .RAW file was located at.
        The .txt file can be used as is to import the points into CAD.
        The .csv file can be open in excel in order to create a tree's table properly formated with all necesary information.
