    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Schwebke-Shiskin & Associatesâ€™ (SS&A) corporate office is located in Miramar, Florida, conveniently centralized between the counties of Miami-Dade and Broward. SS&A offers a wide range of services within the fields of civil engineering, land planning, and land surveying.

Established in 1947, the longevity of our firm is perhaps only rivaled by that of our staff, exemplified by our record of employee retention. Our employees have an average tenure of over ten years. We feel blessed to have a friendly and professional staff that shares a determined attitude.

SS&A has performed a central role in many regional developments and major projects. As such, our firm has learned how to manage large scale efforts and coordinate with other disciplines in a positive proactive team environment. Although our firm currently focuses its practice in the greater South Florida area, we are committed to International endeavors, as well. We have, in the past, been involved with projects in the Caribbean Islands, South America, Central America, and are always open to exploring new possibilities.

Over the years, SS&A has developed strong client relationships that are built on a foundation of experience, knowledge, and trust. As we progress into the future, our mission remains the same. We strive to continue to be a reliable source for knowledge, quality, and results reliant on the same values that our company was founded on over half a century ago.
